# Welcome!!! Karibu!!

We are excited to have you onboard :tada: :boom::open_hands:

In this repository, you will find resources and information to get you up to speed with our culture at the Bioinformatics Group at the Molecular Biology and Bioinformatics Unit, *icipe*. These resources include our code of conduct and the first steps you'll take as you join our group. 

## Bioinformatics Team Vision
**Mission (purpose):** To lead and support cutting-edge bioinformatics research and data management at *icipe*.

**Vision (Picture):** To become a vibrant, productive, innovative, and flexible bioinformatics training, research and data management hub.

**Values:**
- Integrity
- Excellence
- Collaboration


## First steps
1. Read and familiarise yourself with the [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). This document is essential in the Unit.
2. Create your project GitHub repo. Your repo should outline your vision and provide a Roadmap for your research or work. Here are some resources on how to draft a detailed [README](https://mozilla.github.io/open-leadership-training-series/articles/opening-your-project/write-a-great-project-readme/) and create a [Roadmap](https://mozilla.github.io/open-leadership-training-series/articles/opening-your-project/start-your-project-roadmap/). Although these resources are for open projects, they are useful when working with your collaborators (Your supervisors, and your future self) during your project.
3. Familiarise yourself with the research undertaken within the Center and the unit. You can do this through planned lab visits, and by chatting with the students and researchers within the Unit.
